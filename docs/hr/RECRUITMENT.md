  baseSalary: number;
  budgetImpact: number;
  status: 'open' | 'in-progress' | 'filled';
  approvalStatus: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### NewHire
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  candidateName: string;
  positionId: string;
  onboardingStatus: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  startDate: Date;
  probationEndDate: Date;
  salary: number;
  department: string;
  division: string;
}
```

### OnboardingTask
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  newHireId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  dueDate: Date;
  completedDate?: Date;
}
```
